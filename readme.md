This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for radiogenic heat production observations. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.

The Excle workbook documents a content model for interchange documents with data from measurements of Radiogenic Heat Production based on analysis of individual rock samples. Calculation of heat production is based on measured U, Th, and K content, which may derive from chemical analysis, gamma ray spectral analysis or other techniques. Measurement procedures, including instruments used, standards used to calibrate calculation of U, Th, and K, assumptions in calculation of heat production from radiogenic element concentrations, etc. should be carefully described in the Measurement procedure field.
